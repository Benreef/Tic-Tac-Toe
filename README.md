### :page_facing_up: About 

- How to play my great game of Tic Tac

### :pencil2: Planning & Problem Solving

- Create a HTML layout for the game board, 3x3 grid of squares, 
- Use CSS to style the game board which includes the grid
- add a click event listener for all the squares in the grid
- mark clicked square with either a X or O depending on the players turn
- I will have to hard code all possible winning combinations
- Then declare a function to check winning combinations against hard coded wins
- check to see if the game is won (so the game doesnt end after first click). stuck thinking about how many winning combinations there are, I think there is 8, I have noted the positions in my js file
- use that same function to determine the winner
- check to see if game has drawn then reset the board after displaying a message, ideally a button to reset board rather than immediatly.
- check to see if
- display winner

### :scream: to fix :poop:

- Buttons to not click too many times (cause its broken :unamused:)
- toggle between red for player 1 and blue for player 2, because you know.. spiderman

### :sob: Lessons learnt

What I would do differently if I could wind back the clock...

### :white_check_mark: Future features

Cool things I would add if I can keep working on this
